d20DiceSystem_javascript
========================

A way to roll D20 system dice written in Javascript

his program is designed to help Dungeon Masters perform
quick calculations during adventures.

Each function rolls a specified number of dice and provides a number of
outputs based on those rolls.

Outputs:
	Sum
	Total Multiplied
	Dice Array
	Highest & Lowest Dice


I am working on a GUI to go along with this.
